### Question
<br>
Sandro is a well organised person. Every day he makes a list of things which need to be done and enumerates them from 1 to n. However, some things need to be done before others. In this task you have to find out whether Sandro can solve all his duties and if so, print the correct order.
<br>

### Input

In the first line you are given an integer n and m (1<=n<=10000, 1<=m<=1000000). On the next m lines there are two distinct integers x and y, (1<=x,y<=10000) describing that job x needs to be done before job y.
<br>

### Output

Print "Sandro fails." if Sandro cannot complete all his duties on the list. If there is a solution print the correct ordering, the jobs to be done separated by a whitespace. If there are multiple solutions print the one, whose first number is smallest, if there are still multiple solutions, print the one whose second number is smallest, and so on.
